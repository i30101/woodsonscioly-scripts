![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v2.1.0-blue)
![python-versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11-limegreen)
Created using `Python`

## Setup
First download all files and extract them from ZIP. Next, install Python and don't forget to add Python to PATH on the first page you get.

Next, install the required pip libraries using `setup.bat`.

Dependencies:
- `random`, `itertools` (included with Python)
- `requests`
- `tkinter`
- `numpy`

## Deployment
Run `app.py` and enter the number of ciphers you want. Generating the ciphers may take some time so don't close out of the window when it says the app isn't responding.

## Updates
- Version 2.1.0: new user interface and option to save ciphers to file
