This folder contains code for events involving the Arduino platform. 

### Installation


Compiling and uploading code requires using the Arduino IDE. For Windows 11 school laptops, go to `Software Center` and install `Arduino`. For personal laptops, visit [Arduino's Software Page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).


### Code Setup - Robot Tour

Getting the code on your computer: 
- Navigate to `Documents\Arduino` on your local drive
- Create new a new folder `Robot`
- Download `Robot.ino` from this reposity and copy to your new folder
<br>

Adding the MakeBlock library:
- Install the MakeBlock Drive library by installing this [zip](https://codeload.github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries/zip/master) file
- This code is also in the repository
- Unzip file and copy to `Documents\Ardunio\libraries`
<br>

Running your mBot:
- Connect your robot to your computer via a USB-B cable
- Select the right port/board and your board to `Ardunio Uno`
- Hit the arrow or "upload" button to flash code to the Arduino
- If you installed the MakeBlock library, your mBot should be up and running
