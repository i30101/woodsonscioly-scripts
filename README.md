This folder contains code for events involving the Arduino platform. 

### Installation


Compiling and uploading code requires using the Arduino IDE. For Windows 11 school laptops, go to `Software Center` and install `Arduino`. For personal laptops, visit [Arduino's Software Page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).


### Code Setup - Robot Tour

Getting the code on your computer: 
 - Navigate to `Documents\Arduino` on your local drive
 - Create new a new folder `Robot`
 - Download `Robot.ino` from this reposity and copy to your new folder

Adding the MakeBlock library:
 - Install the MakeBlock Drive library by installing this [zip](https://codeload.github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Libraries/zip/master) file
 - This code is also in the repository
 - Unzip file and copy to `Documents\Ardunio\libraries`

Running your mBot:
 - Connect your robot to your computer via a USB-B cable
 - Select the right port/board and set it as an `Ardunio Uno`
 - Hit the arrow or "upload" button to flash code to the Arduino
 - If you installed the MakeBlock library, your mBot should be up and running



### Code Setup - Detector Building
